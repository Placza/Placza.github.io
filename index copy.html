        After the recent threats from the east of Europe and the sudden illness and aging of the people I care about, I found myself pondering an isolated, cold world. I’m laying there, in my bed, the darkness is occupying my room, and I’m left alone with my thoughts. I can’t help but wonder what it would mean if everyone I cared about was gone and I was left alone. The melancholy and weight of this imagery haunts me.

        <h3>Empty room</h3>
        <p>
            Through the window rush dim rays of the moon's radians luminating the room with a dark blue hue. It is as cold to the touch as it is to the eyes. The curtains catching and trapping what little light may shine through.

            Winter memories encourage rumination of one’s own losses. Despite it being winter, there is no snow. Only the freezing touch of the reminiscence of past winters and lonely nights.

            Alone. No one is in sight. No one to turn to. An empty shell that is this world being filled only with the void of ungranted wishes and the stench of one’s mortality. You miss them. You miss them all, and you wonder whether they do it too. You fear they might not. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Silence consumed by the lingering beating far in the distance. It dictates the pace of the night. Loud enough to be heard, yet quite enough to be ignored. The only things in your mind are lost memories and the will to move on.
